logicalView -> developmentView
logicalView --> processView
developmentView --> physicalView
processView -> physicalView

note left of logicalView
    **The Object-Oriented Decomposition**
    The logical architecture primarily supports
    the functional requirementsâ€”what the system
    should provide in terms of services to its users.
end note

note right of developmentView
    **Subsystem decomposition**
    The development architecture focuses on the
    actual software module organization on the
    software development environment.
end note

note right of physicalView
    **Mapping the software to the hardware**
    The physical architecture takes into account
    primarily the non-functional requirements of
    the system such as availability, reliability
    (fault-tolerance), performance (throughput)
    and scalability.
end note

note left of processView
    **The Process Decomposition**
    The process architecture takes into account
    some non-functional requirements, such as
    performance and availability.
end note

processView -[hidden]-- scenarios

note right of scenarios
    **Putting it all together**
    The elements in the four views are shown to
    work together seamlessly by the use of a small
    set of important scenarios.
